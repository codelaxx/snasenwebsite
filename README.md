Just a tutorial I was checking out, now added some simple game project and tested out github pages.

Be warned, if you enable Jekyl on the page, suddenly it overwrites your readme.md file, and if you are currently editing the file, and trie to commit the file after the jekyl setting has comitted to it, your changes are magically lost, silently, poof.

Anyways, guide from scratch

- Create account on github
- Create repo on your account
- Add a readme.md file if you like (optional)
- Create an index.html file (preferrably with this name), or another name if you don't mind writing a longer url to your github pages page.
- Put som valid html in the file, like <html><body><h1>Hello</h1></body></html>
- Commit/save changes in file
- Go to settings of repo
- Scroll down and select 'Pages'
- Select master from dropdown
- Skip Jekyl, and I assume you want to skip licence also, but that is up to you.
- Click save
- Wait a little while, and the url for the page will be shown , something like https://codelaxx.github.io/snasenwebsite/ , but with your username in the start of the url, and your repo name in the end of the url. If you didn't use index.html for your file name, you will have to add that after the last / to open that file (index.html is opened by default by browsers so that's why you don't have to put that in the url, but you can test it here and it will work like https://codelaxx.github.io/snasenwebsite/index.html)

Tada, you are online with your page or pages

Now create a new repo and play arround with Jekyl with a pretty template or five (and change template after you have created your page, just to see how good it may look).
